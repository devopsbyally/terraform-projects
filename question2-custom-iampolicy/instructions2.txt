Create a custom IAM policy that allows read and write access to a specific S3
bucket (use bucket name: "tf-s3bucket-11.12" which was created in question1)
then create an IAM role that can be assigned to an EC2 instance using Terraform.

Validation:- Also try to login to ec2, create one file and run aws cli command to upload
create file to s3 bucket
