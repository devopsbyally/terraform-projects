Create an Amazon EC2 instance running RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and attach a
security group with port 22 (SSH) and port 8080 and also install and configure Jenkins
via userdata script. You can use AWS Data Source to fetch the latest RHEL AMI.

Note : use variables and output as much as possible.
