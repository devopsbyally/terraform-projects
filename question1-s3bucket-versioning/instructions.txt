Create an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, upload an object, and make the bucket
public so that anyone can access it using Terraform

Note: Use variables as much as possible, such as for the bucket name, tags, etc.
Also, use an output block to display the bucket name and object URL.

Hint : Add a bucket policy to make the bucket public and also Enable public access for the
Bucket
